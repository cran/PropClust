Description: Implementation of propensity clustering and
        decomposition as described in Ranola et al. (2013) <doi:10.1186/1752-0509-7-21>. 
        Propensity decomposition can be viewed on the
        one hand as a generalization of the eigenvector-based
        approximation of correlation networks, and on the other hand as
        a generalization of random multigraph models and
        conformity-based decompositions.
